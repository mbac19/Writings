        Lauded and glorified art Thou, O Lord, my God! How can I make mention of
        Thee, magnify assured as I am that no tongue, however deep its wisdom,
        can befittingly magnify Thy name, nor can the bird of the human heart,
        however great its longing, ever hope to ascend into the heaven of Thy
        majesty and knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        If I describe Thee, O my God, as Him Who is the All-Perceiving, I find
        myself compelled to admit that They Who are the highest Embodiments of
        perception have been created by virtue of Thy behest. And if I extol
        Thee as Him Who is the All-Wise, I, likewise, am forced to recognize
        that the Wellsprings of wisdom have themselves been generated through
        the operation of Thy Will. And if I proclaim Thee as the Incomparable
        One, I soon discover that they Who are the inmost essence of oneness
        have been sent down by Thee and are but the evidences of Thine
        handiwork. And if I acclaim Thee as the Knower of all things, I must
        confess that they Who are the Quintessence of knowledge are but the
        creation and instruments of Thy Purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Exalted, immeasurably exalted, art Thou above the strivings of mortal
        man to unravel Thy mystery, to describe Thy glory, or even to hint at
        the nature of Thine Essence. For whatever such strivings may accomplish,
        they never can hope to transcend the limitations imposed upon Thy
        creatures, inasmuch as these efforts are actuated by Thy decree, and are
        begotten of Thine invention. The loftiest sentiments which the holiest
        of saints can express in praise of Thee, and the deepest wisdom which
        the most learned of men can utter in their attempts to comprehend Thy
        nature, all revolve around that Center Which is wholly subjected to Thy
        sovereignty, Which adoreth Thy Beauty, and is propelled through the
        movement of Thy Pen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nay, forbid it, O my God, that I should have uttered such words as must
        of necessity imply the existence of any direct relationship between the
        Pen of Thy Revelation and the essence of all created things. Far, far
        are They Who are related to Thee above the conception of such
        relationship! All comparisons and likenesses fail to do justice to the
        Tree of Thy Revelation, and every way is barred to the comprehension of
        the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Dayspring of Thy Beauty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Far, far from Thy glory be what mortal man can affirm of Thee, or
        attribute unto Thee, or the praise with which he can glorify Thee!
        Whatever duty Thou hast prescribed unto Thy servants of extolling to the
        utmost Thy majesty and glory is but a token of Thy grace unto them, that
        they may be enabled to ascend unto the station conferred upon their own
        inmost being, the station of the knowledge of their own selves.
      </p>

      <p>
        No one else besides Thee hath, at any time, been able to fathom Thy
        mystery, or befittingly to extol Thy greatness. Unsearchable and high
        above the praise of men wilt Thou remain forever. There is none other
        God but Thee, the Inaccessible, the Omnipotent, the Omniscient, the Holy
        of Holies.

        The beginning of all things is the knowledge of God, and the end of all
        things is the strict observance of whatsoever hath been sent down from
        the empyrean of the Divine Will that pervadeth all that is in the
        heavens and all that is on the earth.

        The Revelation which, from time immemorial, hath been acclaimed as the
        Purpose and Promise of all the Prophets of God, and the most cherished
        Desire of His Messengers, hath now, by virtue of the pervasive Will of
        the Almighty and at His irresistible bidding, been revealed unto men.
        The advent of such a Revelation hath been heralded in all the sacred
        Scriptures. Behold how, notwithstanding such an announcement, mankind
        hath strayed from its path and shut out itself from its glory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Say: O ye lovers of the One true God! Strive, that ye may truly
        recognize and know Him, and observe befittingly His precepts. This is a
        Revelation, under which, if a man shed for its sake one drop of blood,
        myriads of oceans will be his recompense. Take heed, O friends, that ye
        forfeit not so inestimable a benefit, or disregard its transcendent
        station. Consider the multitude of lives that have been, and are still
        being, sacrificed in a world deluded by a mere phantom which the vain
        imaginations of its peoples have conceived. Render thanks unto God,
        inasmuch as ye have attained unto your heart’s Desire, and been united
        to Him Who is the Promise of all nations. Guard ye, with the aid of the
        one true God—exalted be His glory—the integrity of the station which ye
        have attained, and cleave to that which shall promote His Cause. He,
        verily, enjoineth on you what is right and conducive to the exaltation
        of man’s station. Glorified be the All-Merciful, the Revealer of this
        wondrous Tablet.

        This is the Day in which God’s most excellent favors have been poured
        out upon men, the Day in which His most mighty grace hath been infused
        into all created things. It is incumbent upon all the peoples of the
        world to reconcile their differences, and, with perfect unity and peace,
        abide beneath the shadow of the Tree of His care and loving-kindness. It
        behooveth them to cleave to whatsoever will, in this Day, be conducive
        to the exaltation of their stations, and to the promotion of their best
        interests. Happy are those whom the all-glorious Pen was moved to
        remember, and blessed are those men whose names, by virtue of Our
        inscrutable decree, We have preferred to conceal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beseech ye the one true God to grant that all men may be graciously
        assisted to fulfill that which is acceptable in Our sight. Soon will the
        present-day order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead.
        Verily, thy Lord speaketh the truth, and is the Knower of things unseen.

        This is the Day whereon the Ocean of God’s mercy hath been manifested
        unto men, the Day in which the Daystar of His loving-kindness hath shed
        its radiance upon them, the Day in which the clouds of His bountiful
        favor have overshadowed the whole of mankind. Now is the time to cheer
        and refresh the down-cast through the invigorating breeze of love and
        fellowship, and the living waters of friendliness and charity.
      </p>

      <p>
        They who are the beloved of God, in whatever place they gather and
        whomsoever they may meet, must evince, in their attitude towards God,
        and in the manner of their celebration of His praise and glory, such
        humility and submissiveness that every atom of the dust beneath their
        feet may attest the depth of their devotion. The conversation carried by
        these holy souls should be informed with such power that these same
        atoms of dust will be thrilled by its influence. They should conduct
        themselves in such manner that the earth upon which they tread may never
        be allowed to address to them such words as these: “I am to be preferred
        above you. For witness, how patient I am in bearing the burden which the
        husbandman layeth upon me. I am the instrument that continually
        imparteth unto all beings the blessings with which He Who is the Source
        of all grace hath entrusted me. Notwithstanding the honor conferred upon
        me, and the unnumbered evidences of my wealth—a wealth that supplieth
        the needs of all creation—behold the measure of my humility, witness
        with what absolute submissiveness I allow myself to be trodden beneath
        the feet of men.…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Show forbearance and benevolence and love to one another. Should anyone
        among you be incapable of grasping a certain truth, or be striving to
        comprehend it, show forth, when conversing with him, a spirit of extreme
        kindliness and goodwill. Help him to see and recognize the truth,
        without esteeming yourself to be, in the least, superior to him, or to
        be possessed of greater endowments.
      </p>

      <p>
        The whole duty of man in this Day is to attain that share of the flood
        of grace which God poureth forth for him. Let none, therefore, consider
        the largeness or smallness of the receptacle. The portion of some might
        lie in the palm of a man’s hand, the portion of others might fill a cup,
        and of others even a gallon-measure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every eye, in this Day, should seek what will best promote the Cause of
        God. He, Who is the Eternal Truth, beareth Me witness! Nothing whatever
        can, in this Day, inflict a greater harm upon this Cause than dissension
        and strife, contention, estrangement and apathy, among the loved ones of
        God. Flee them, through the power of God and His sovereign aid, and
        strive ye to knit together the hearts of men, in His Name, the Unifier,
        the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Beseech ye the one true God to grant that
        ye may taste the savor of such deeds as are performed in His path, and
        partake of the sweetness of such humility and submissiveness as are
        shown for His sake. Forget your own selves, and turn your eyes towards
        your neighbor. Bend your energies to whatever may foster the education
        of men. Nothing is, or can ever be, hidden from God. If ye follow in His
        way, His incalculable and imperishable blessings will be showered upon
        you. This is the luminous Tablet, whose verses have streamed from the
        moving Pen of Him Who is the Lord of all worlds. Ponder it in your
        hearts, and be ye of them that observe its precepts.
