  DEVELOPER NOTES:
    - May want a way to take notes about the text but not directly pointing to
      any passage. Some in-depth studies do a historical context or provide side
      notes on the text, it's hard to tie that to a particular passage.

  Notes taken from the study of the Iqán with Kathy Hogenson.

  HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
    - From Shoghi Effendi, see GPB on significance of the Iqán.
    - The Báb had 3 uncles: one of the uncles raised Him. The Iqán was a tablet
      written to one of the other uncles: Hájí Miraá Siyyid Muhammad, who came to
      Baghdád in 1861 to meet with Bahá'u'lláh to ask Him what had hapenned with his
      nephew -- the Báb -- and brother -- Hají Mírza Siyyid Alí.
    - The Iqán was written in 48 hours -- in GPB, says 2 days and 2 nights after the uncle
      submitted questions. In the handwriting of the Master, who was 17 years old at the time.

    Bahá'u'lláh begins by providing the prerequisites before we can even begin understanding
    this Work. Addresses mankind, not just the uncle.

    Discusses characteristics of the reader that they must achieve to understand the work.

    Kathy: "The more education we have the harder it is [to understand the Writings]"

    The 950 years of Noah likely represents the length of Noah's relevation. Similar to the other
    prophets mentioned in the Bible.
  </p>

  <p data-ref="Iqán 27">
    "Heaven and earth shall pass away but My word shall not pass away". This quote is used to explain
    that the second coming of Jesus will not change scripture.
  </p>

  <p data-ref="Iqán 31">
    Bahá'u'lláh clarifies "opression" as meaning the period after a Manifestation appears, direct guidance
    is removed from mankind and we are required to interpret and acquire scripture for ourselves.
