        This is the Day in which the testimony of the Lord hath been fulfilled,
        the Day in which the Word of God hath been made manifest, and His
        evidence firmly established. His voice is calling you unto that which
        shall profit you, and enjoineth you to observe that which shall draw you
        nigh unto God, the Lord of Revelation.

      <p>IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD, THE EXALTED, THE MOST HIGH.</p>

      <p>
        No man shall attain the shores of the ocean of true understanding except
        he be detached from all that is in heaven and on earth. Sanctify your
        souls, O ye peoples of the world, that haply ye may attain that station
        which God hath destined for you and enter thus the tabernacle which,
        according to the dispensations of Providence, hath been raised in the
        firmament of the Bayán.

        The essence of these words is this: they that tread the path of faith,
        they that thirst for the wine of certitude, must cleanse themselves of
        all that is earthly—their ears from idle talk, their minds from vain
        imaginings, their hearts from worldly affections, their eyes from that
        which perisheth. They should put their trust in God, and, holding fast
        unto Him, follow in His way. Then will they be made worthy of the
        effulgent glories of the sun of divine knowledge and understanding, and
        become the recipients of a grace that is infinite and unseen, inasmuch
        as man can never hope to attain unto the knowledge of the All-Glorious,
        can never quaff from the stream of divine knowledge and wisdom, can
        never enter the abode of immortality, nor partake of the cup of divine
        nearness and favor, unless and until he ceases to regard the words and
        deeds of mortal men as a standard for the true understanding and
        recognition of God and His Prophets.
      </p>

      <!-- 4 -->
      <p>
        Consider the past. How many, both high and low, have, at all times,
        yearningly awaited the advent of the Manifestations of God in the
        sanctified persons of His chosen Ones. How often have they expected His
        coming, how frequently have they prayed that the breeze of divine mercy
        might blow, and the promised Beauty step forth from behind the veil of
        concealment, and be made manifest to all the world. And whensoever the
        portals of grace did open, and the clouds of divine bounty did rain upon
        mankind, and the light of the Unseen did shine above the horizon of
        celestial might, they all denied Him, and turned away from His face—the
        face of God Himself. Refer ye, to verify this truth, to that which hath
        been recorded in every sacred Book.
      </p>

      <!-- 5 -->
      <p>
        Ponder for a moment, and reflect upon that which hath been the cause of
        such denial on the part of those who have searched with such earnestness
        and longing. Their attack hath been more fierce than tongue or pen can
        describe. Not one single Manifestation of Holiness hath appeared but He
        was afflicted by the denials, the repudiation, and the vehement
        opposition of the people around Him. Thus it hath been revealed:
        <span data-ref="Qur'án 36:30">
          “O the misery of men! No Messenger cometh unto them but they laugh Him
          to scorn.”
        </span>
        Again He saith:
        <span data-ref="Qur'án 40:5">
          “Each nation hath plotted darkly against their Messenger to lay
          violent hold on Him, and disputed with vain words to invalidate the
          truth.”
        </span>
      </p>

      <!-- 6 -->
      <p>
        In like manner, those words that have streamed forth from the source of
        power and descended from the heaven of glory are innumerable and beyond
        the ordinary comprehension of man. To them that are possessed of true
        understanding and insight the Súrah of Húd surely sufficeth. Ponder a
        while those holy words in your heart, and, with utter detachment, strive
        to grasp their meaning. Examine the wondrous behavior of the Prophets,
        and recall the defamations and denials uttered by the children of
        negation and falsehood, perchance you may cause the bird of the human
        heart to wing its flight away from the abodes of heedlessness and doubt
        unto the nest of faith and certainty, and drink deep from the pure
        waters of ancient wisdom, and partake of the fruit of the tree of divine
        knowledge. Such is the share of the pure in heart of the bread that hath
        descended from the realms of eternity and holiness.
      </p>

      <!-- 7 -->
      <p>
        Should you acquaint yourself with the indignities heaped upon the
        Prophets of God, and apprehend the true causes of the objections voiced
        by their oppressors, you will surely appreciate the significance of
        their position. Moreover, the more closely you observe the denials of
        those who have opposed the Manifestations of the divine attributes, the
        firmer will be your faith in the Cause of God. Accordingly, a brief
        mention will be made in this Tablet of divers accounts relative to the
        Prophets of God, that they may demonstrate the truth that throughout all
        ages and centuries the Manifestations of power and glory have been
        subjected to such heinous cruelties that no pen dare describe them.
        Perchance this may enable a few to cease to be perturbed by the clamor
        and protestations of the divines and the foolish of this age, and cause
        them to strengthen their confidence and certainty.
      </p>

      <!-- 8 -->
      <p>
        Among the Prophets was Noah. For nine hundred and fifty years He
        prayerfully exhorted His people and summoned them to the haven of
        security and peace. None, however, heeded His call. Each day they
        inflicted on His blessed person such pain and suffering that no one
        believed He could survive. How frequently they denied Him, how
        malevolently they hinted their suspicion against Him! Thus it hath been
        revealed:
        <span data-ref="Qur'án 11:38">
          “And as often as a company of His people passed by Him, they derided
          Him. To them He said: ‘Though ye scoff at us now, we will scoff at you
          hereafter even as ye scoff at us. In the end ye shall know.’”
        </span>
        Long afterward, He several times promised victory to His companions and
        fixed the hour thereof. But when the hour struck, the divine promise was
        not fulfilled. This caused a few among the small number of His followers
        to turn away from Him, and to this testify the records of the best-known
        books. These you must certainly have perused; if not, undoubtedly you
        will. Finally, as stated in books and traditions, there remained with
        Him only forty or seventy-two of His followers. At last from the depth
        of His being He cried aloud:
        <span data-ref="Qurán 71:26">
          “Lord! Leave not upon the land a single dweller from among the
          unbelievers.”
        </span>
      </p>

      <!-- 9 -->
      <p>
        And now, consider and reflect a moment upon the waywardness of this
        people. What could have been the reason for such denial and avoidance on
        their part? What could have induced them to refuse to put off the
        garment of denial, and to adorn themselves with the robe of acceptance?
        Moreover, what could have caused the nonfulfillment of the divine
        promise which led the seekers to reject that which they had accepted?
        Meditate profoundly, that the secret of things unseen may be revealed
        unto you, that you may inhale the sweetness of a spiritual and
        imperishable fragrance, and that you may acknowledge the truth that from
        time immemorial even unto eternity the Almighty hath tried, and will
        continue to try, His servants, so that light may be distinguished from
        darkness, truth from falsehood, right from wrong, guidance from error,
        happiness from misery, and roses from thorns. Even as He hath revealed:
        <span data-ref="Qur'án 29:2">
          “Do men think when they say ‘We believe’ they shall be let alone and
          not be put to proof?”
        </span>
      </p>

      <!-- 10 -->
      <p>
        And after Noah the light of the countenance of Húd shone forth above the
        horizon of creation. For well-nigh seven hundred years, according to the
        sayings of men, He exhorted the people to turn their faces and draw
        nearer unto the Riḍván of the divine presence. What showers of
        afflictions rained upon Him, until at last His adjurations bore the
        fruit of increased rebelliousness, and His assiduous endeavors resulted
        in the willful blindness of His people.
        <span data-ref="Qur'án 35:39">
          “And their unbelief shall only increase for the unbelievers their own
          perdition.”
        </span>
      </p>

      <!-- 11 -->
      <p>
        And after Him there appeared from the Riḍván of the Eternal, the
        Invisible, the holy person of Ṣáliḥ, Who again summoned the people to
        the river of everlasting life. For over a hundred years He admonished
        them to hold fast unto the commandments of God and eschew that which is
        forbidden. His admonitions, however, yielded no fruit, and His pleading
        proved of no avail. Several times He retired and lived in seclusion. All
        this, although that eternal Beauty was summoning the people to no other
        than the city of God. Even as it is revealed:
        <span data-ref="Qur'án 11:61-62">
          “And unto the tribe of Thamúd We sent their brother Ṣáliḥ. ‘O my
          people,’ said He, ‘Worship God, ye have none other God beside Him.…’
          They made reply: ‘O Ṣáliḥ, our hopes were fixed on thee until now;
          forbiddest thou us to worship that which our fathers worshipped? Truly
          we misdoubt that whereunto thou callest us as suspicious.’”
        </span>
        All this proved fruitless, until at last there went up a great cry, and
        all fell into utter perdition.
      </p>

      <!-- 12 -->
      <p>
        Later, the beauty of the countenance of the
        <span data-alias="Abraham">Friend of God</span>
        appeared from behind the veil, and another standard of divine guidance
        was hoisted. He invited the people of the earth to the light of
        righteousness. The more passionately He exhorted them, the fiercer waxed
        the envy and waywardness of the people, except those who wholly detached
        themselves from all save God, and ascended on the wings of certainty to
        the station which God hath exalted beyond the comprehension of men. It
        is well known what a host of enemies besieged Him, until at last the
        fires of envy and rebellion were kindled against Him. And after the
        episode of the fire came to pass, He, the lamp of God amongst men, was,
        as recorded in all books and chronicles, expelled from His city.
      </p>

      <!-- 13 HERE I AM -->
      <p>
        And when His day was ended, there came the turn of Moses. Armed with the
        rod of celestial dominion, adorned with the white hand of divine
        knowledge, and proceeding from the Párán of the love of God, and
        wielding the serpent of power and everlasting majesty, He shone forth
        from the Sinai of light upon the world. He summoned all the peoples and
        kindreds of the earth to the kingdom of eternity, and invited them to
        partake of the fruit of the tree of faithfulness. Surely you are aware
        of the fierce opposition of Pharaoh and his people, and of the stones of
        idle fancy which the hands of infidels cast upon that blessed Tree. So
        much so that Pharaoh and his people finally arose and exerted their
        utmost endeavor to extinguish with the waters of falsehood and denial
        the fire of that sacred Tree, oblivious of the truth that no earthly
        water can quench the flame of divine wisdom, nor mortal blasts
        extinguish the lamp of everlasting dominion. Nay, rather, such water
        cannot but intensify the burning of the flame, and such blasts cannot
        but ensure the preservation of the lamp, were ye to observe with the eye
        of discernment, and walk in the way of God’s holy will and pleasure. How
        well hath a believer of the kindred of Pharaoh, whose story is recounted
        by the All-Glorious in His Book revealed unto His beloved One, observed:
        “And a man of the family of Pharaoh who was a believer and concealed his
        faith said: ‘Will ye slay a man because he saith my Lord is God, when He
        hath already come to you with signs from your Lord? If he be a liar, on
        him will be his lie, but if he be a man of truth, part of what he
        threateneth will fall upon you. In truth God guideth not him who is a
        transgressor, a liar.’” Finally, so great was their iniquity that this
        selfsame believer was put to a shameful death. “The curse of God be upon
        the people of tyranny.”
      </p>

      <!-- 14 -->
      <p>
        And now, ponder upon these things. What could have caused such
        contention and conflict? Why is it that the advent of every true
        Manifestation of God hath been accompanied by such strife and tumult, by
        such tyranny and upheaval? This notwithstanding the fact that all the
        Prophets of God, whenever made manifest unto the peoples of the world,
        have invariably foretold the coming of yet another Prophet after them,
        and have established such signs as would herald the advent of the future
        Dispensation. To this the records of all sacred books bear witness. Why
        then is it that despite the expectation of men in their quest of the
        Manifestations of Holiness, and in spite of the signs recorded in the
        sacred books, such acts of violence, of oppression and cruelty, should
        have been perpetrated in every age and cycle against all the Prophets
        and chosen Ones of God? Even as He hath revealed: “As oft as an Apostle
        cometh unto you with that which your souls desire not, ye swell with
        pride, accusing some of being impostors and slaying others.”
      </p>

      <!-- 15 -->
      <!-- Also in Gleanings -->
      <p>
        Reflect, what could have been the motive for such deeds? What could have
        prompted such behavior towards the Revealers of the beauty of the
        All-Glorious? Whatever in days gone by hath been the cause of the denial
        and opposition of those people hath now led to the perversity of the
        people of this age. To maintain that the testimony of Providence was
        incomplete, that it hath therefore been the cause of the denial of the
        people, is but open blasphemy. How far from the grace of the
        All-Bountiful and from His loving providence and tender mercies it is to
        single out a soul from amongst all men for the guidance of His
        creatures, and, on one hand, to withhold from Him the full measure of
        His divine testimony, and, on the other, inflict severe retribution on
        His people for having turned away from His chosen One! Nay, the manifold
        bounties of the Lord of all beings have, at all times, through the
        Manifestations of His divine Essence, encompassed the earth and all that
        dwell therein. Not for a moment hath His grace been withheld, nor have
        the showers of His loving-kindness ceased to rain upon mankind.
        Consequently, such behavior can be attributed to naught save the
        petty-mindedness of such souls as tread the valley of arrogance and
        pride, are lost in the wilds of remoteness, walk in the ways of their
        idle fancy, and follow the dictates of the leaders of their faith. Their
        chief concern is mere opposition; their sole desire is to ignore the
        truth. Unto every discerning observer it is evident and manifest that
        had these people in the days of each of the Manifestations of the Sun of
        Truth sanctified their eyes, their ears, and their hearts from whatever
        they had seen, heard, and felt, they surely would not have been deprived
        of beholding the beauty of God, nor strayed far from the habitations of
        glory. But having weighed the testimony of God by the standard of their
        own knowledge, gleaned from the teachings of the leaders of their faith,
        and found it at variance with their limited understanding, they arose to
        perpetrate such unseemly acts.
      </p>

      <!-- 16 -->
      <p>
        Leaders of religion, in every age, have hindered their people from
        attaining the shores of eternal salvation, inasmuch as they held the
        reins of authority in their mighty grasp. Some for the lust of
        leadership, others through want of knowledge and understanding, have
        been the cause of the deprivation of the people. By their sanction and
        authority, every Prophet of God hath drunk from the chalice of
        sacrifice, and winged His flight unto the heights of glory. What
        unspeakable cruelties they that have occupied the seats of authority and
        learning have inflicted upon the true Monarchs of the world, those Gems
        of divine virtue! Content with a transitory dominion, they have deprived
        themselves of an everlasting sovereignty. Thus, their eyes beheld not
        the light of the countenance of the Well-Beloved, nor did their ears
        hearken unto the sweet melodies of the Bird of Desire. For this reason,
        in all sacred books mention hath been made of the divines of every age.
        Thus He saith: “O people of the Book! Why disbelieve the signs of God to
        which ye yourselves have been witnesses?” And also He saith: “O people
        of the Book! Why clothe ye the truth with falsehood? Why wittingly hide
        the truth?” Again, He saith: “Say, O people of the Book! Why repel
        believers from the way of God?” It is evident that by the “people of the
        Book,” who have repelled their fellowmen from the straight path of God,
        is meant none other than the divines of that age, whose names and
        character have been revealed in the sacred books, and alluded to in the
        verses and traditions recorded therein, were you to observe with the eye
        of God.
      </p>

      <!-- 17 -->
      <p>
        With fixed and steady gaze, born of the unerring eye of God, scan for a
        while the horizon of divine knowledge, and contemplate those words of
        perfection which the Eternal hath revealed, that haply the mysteries of
        divine wisdom, hidden ere now beneath the veil of glory and treasured
        within the tabernacle of His grace, may be made manifest unto you. The
        denials and protestations of these leaders of religion have, in the
        main, been due to their lack of knowledge and understanding. Those words
        uttered by the Revealers of the beauty of the one true God, setting
        forth the signs that should herald the advent of the Manifestation to
        come, they never understood nor fathomed. Hence they raised the standard
        of revolt, and stirred up mischief and sedition. It is obvious and
        manifest that the true meaning of the utterances of the Birds of
        Eternity is revealed to none except those that manifest the Eternal
        Being, and the melodies of the Nightingale of Holiness can reach no ear
        save that of the denizens of the everlasting realm. The Copt of tyranny
        can never partake of the cup touched by the lips of the Sept of justice,
        and the Pharaoh of unbelief can never hope to recognize the hand of the
        Moses of truth. Even as He saith: “None knoweth the meaning thereof
        except God and them that are well-grounded in knowledge.” And yet, they
        have sought the interpretation of the Book from those that are wrapt in
        veils, and have refused to seek enlightenment from the fountainhead of
        knowledge.

      <!-- 18 -->
      <p>
        And when the days of Moses were ended, and the light of Jesus, shining
        forth from the dayspring of the Spirit, encompassed the world, all the
        people of Israel arose in protest against Him. They clamored that He
        Whose advent the Bible had foretold must needs promulgate and fulfill
        the laws of Moses, whereas this youthful Nazarene, who laid claim to the
        station of the divine Messiah, had annulled the law of divorce and of
        the sabbath day—the most weighty of all the laws of Moses. Moreover,
        what of the signs of the Manifestation yet to come? These people of
        Israel are even unto the present day still expecting that Manifestation
        which the Bible hath foretold! How many Manifestations of Holiness, how
        many Revealers of the light everlasting, have appeared since the time of
        Moses, and yet Israel, wrapt in the densest veils of satanic fancy and
        false imaginings, is still expectant that the idol of her own handiwork
        will appear with such signs as she herself hath conceived! Thus hath God
        laid hold of them for their sins, hath extinguished in them the spirit
        of faith, and tormented them with the flames of the nethermost fire. And
        this for no other reason except that Israel refused to apprehend the
        meaning of such words as have been revealed in the Bible concerning the
        signs of the coming Revelation. As she never grasped their true
        significance, and, to outward seeming, such events never came to pass,
        she, therefore, remained deprived of recognizing the beauty of Jesus and
        of beholding the face of God. And they still await His coming! From time
        immemorial even unto this day, all the kindreds and peoples of the earth
        have clung to such fanciful and unseemly thoughts, and thus have
        deprived themselves of the clear waters streaming from the springs of
        purity and holiness.

        In unfolding these mysteries, We have, in Our former Tablets which were
        addressed to a friend in the melodious language of Ḥijáz, cited a few of
        the verses revealed unto the Prophets of old. And now, responding to
        your request, We again shall cite, in these pages, those same verses,
        uttered this time in the wondrous accents of ‘Iráq, that haply the sore
        athirst in the wilds of remoteness may attain unto the ocean of the
        divine presence, and they that languish in the wastes of separation be
        led unto the home of eternal reunion. Thus the mists of error may be
        dispelled, and the all-resplendent light of divine guidance dawn forth
        above the horizon of human hearts. In God We put Our trust, and to Him
        We cry for help, that haply there may flow from this pen that which
        shall quicken the souls of men, that they may all arise from their beds
        of heedlessness and hearken unto the rustling of the leaves of Paradise,
        from the tree which the hand of divine power hath, by the permission of
        God, planted in the Riḍván of the All-Glorious.

        To them that are endowed with understanding, it is clear and manifest
        that when the fire of the love of Jesus consumed the veils of Jewish
        limitations, and His authority was made apparent and partially enforced,
        He, the Revealer of the unseen Beauty, addressing one day His disciples,
        referred unto His passing, and, kindling in their hearts the fire of
        bereavement, said unto them: “I go away and come again unto you.” And in
        another place He said: “I go and another will come Who will tell you all
        that I have not told you, and will fulfill all that I have said.” Both
        these sayings have but one meaning, were you to ponder upon the
        Manifestations of the Unity of God with divine insight.

        Every discerning observer will recognize that in the Dispensation of the
        Qur’án both the Book and the Cause of Jesus were confirmed. As to the
        matter of names, Muḥammad, Himself, declared: “I am Jesus.” He
        recognized the truth of the signs, prophecies, and words of Jesus, and
        testified that they were all of God. In this sense, neither the person
        of Jesus nor His writings hath differed from that of Muḥammad and of His
        holy Book, inasmuch as both have championed the Cause of God, uttered
        His praise, and revealed His commandments. Thus it is that Jesus,
        Himself, declared: “I go away and come again unto you.” Consider the
        sun. Were it to say now, “I am the sun of yesterday,” it would speak the
        truth. And should it, bearing the sequence of time in mind, claim to be
        other than that sun, it still would speak the truth. In like manner, if
        it be said that all the days are but one and the same, it is correct and
        true. And if it be said, with respect to their particular names and
        designations, that they differ, that again is true. For though they are
        the same, yet one doth recognize in each a separate designation, a
        specific attribute, a particular character. Conceive accordingly the
        distinction, variation, and unity characteristic of the various
        Manifestations of holiness, that thou mayest comprehend the allusions
        made by the Creator of all names and attributes to the mysteries of
        distinction and unity, and discover the answer to thy question as to why
        that everlasting Beauty should have, at sundry times, called Himself by
        different names and titles.

        Afterwards, the companions and disciples of Jesus asked Him concerning
        those signs that must needs signalize the return of His manifestation.
        When, they asked, shall these things be? Several times they questioned
        that peerless Beauty, and, every time He made reply, He set forth a
        special sign that should herald the advent of the promised Dispensation.
        To this testify the records of the four Gospels.

        This wronged One will cite but one of these instances, thus conferring
        upon mankind, for the sake of God, such bounties as are yet concealed
        within the treasury of the hidden and sacred Tree, that haply mortal men
        may not remain deprived of their share of the immortal fruit, and attain
        to a dewdrop of the waters of everlasting life which, from Baghdád, the
        “Abode of Peace,” are being vouchsafed unto all mankind. We ask for
        neither meed nor reward. “We nourish your souls for the sake of God; we
        seek from you neither recompense nor thanks.” This is the food that
        conferreth everlasting life upon the pure in heart and the illumined in
        spirit. This is the bread of which it is said: “Lord, send down upon us
        Thy bread from heaven.” This bread shall never be withheld from them
        that deserve it, nor can it ever be exhausted. It groweth everlastingly
        from the tree of grace; it descendeth at all seasons from the heavens of
        justice and mercy. Even as He saith: “Seest thou not to what God
        likeneth a good word? To a good tree; its root firmly fixed, and its
        branches reaching unto heaven: yielding its fruit in all seasons.”
