        In the name of God, the One, the Incompatable, the All-Powerful, the
        All-Knowing, the All-Wise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Praise be to God, the Eternal that perisheth not, the Everlasting that
        declineth not, the Self-Subsisting that altereth not. He it is Who is
        transcendent in His sovereignty, Who is manifest through His signs, and
        is hidden through His mysteries. He it is at Whose bidding the standard
        of the Most Exalted Word hath been lifted up in the world of creation,
        and the banner of “He doeth whatsoever He willeth” raised amidst all
        peoples. He it is Who hath revealed His Cause for the guidance of His
        creatures, and sent down His verses to demonstrate His Proof and His
        Testimony, and embellished the preface of the Book of Man with the
        ornament of utterance through His saying: “The God of Mercy hath taught
        the Qur’án, hath created man, and taught him articulate speech.” No God
        is there but Him, the One, the Peerless, the Powerful, the Mighty, the
        Beneficent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The light that is shed from the heaven of bounty, and the benediction
        that shineth from the dawning-place of the
        <typo original="will">Will</typo> of God, the Lord of the Kingdom of
        Names, rest upon Him Who is the Supreme Mediator, the Most Exalted Pen,
        Him Whom God hath made the Dawning-Place of His most excellent names and
        the Dayspring of His most exalted attributes. Through Him the light of
        unity hath shone forth above the horizon of the world, and the law of
        oneness hath been revealed amidst the nations, who, with radiant faces,
        have turned towards the Supreme Horizon, and acknowledged that which the
        Tongue of Utterance hath spoken in the kingdom of His knowledge: “Earth
        and heaven, glory and dominion, are God’s, the Omnipotent, the Almighty,
        the Lord of grace abounding!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Give ear, O distinguished divine, unto the voice of this Wronged One. He
        verily, counselleth thee for the sake of God, and exhorteth thee unto
        that which will cause thee to draw nigh unto Him under all conditions.
        He, in truth, is the All-Possessing, the Exalted. Know thou that the ear
        of man hath been created that it may hearken unto the Divine Voice on
        this Day that hath been mentioned in all the Books, Scriptures, and
        Tablets. Purify thou, first, thy soul with the waters of renunciation,
        and adorn thine head with the crown of the fear of God, and thy temple
        with the ornament of reliance upon Him. Arise, then, and, with thy face
        set towards the Most Great House, the Spot round which, as decreed by
        the Eternal King, all that dwell on earth must circle, recite:
      </p>

      <p>
        “O God, my God, and my Desire, and my Adored One, and my Master, and my
        Mainstay, and my utmost Hope, and my supreme Aspiration! Thou seest me
        turning towards Thee, holding fast unto the cord of Thy bounty, clinging
        to the hem of Thy generosity, acknowledging the sanctity of Thy Self and
        the purity of Thine Essence, and testifying to Thy unity and Thy
        oneness. I bear witness that Thou art the One, the Single, the
        Incomparable, the Ever-Abiding. Thou didst not take unto Thyself a
        partner in Thy dominion, nor didst Thou choose a peer for Thyself upon
        earth. All created things have borne witness unto that which the Tongue
        of Thy grandeur hath testified ere their creation. Verily Thou art God;
        there is none other God but Thee! From everlasting Thou wast sanctified
        from the mention of Thy servants, and exalted above the description of
        Thy creatures. Thou beholdest, O Lord, the ignorant seeking the ocean of
        Thy knowledge, the sore athirst the living waters of Thine utterance,
        the abased the tabernacle of Thy glory, the poor the treasury of Thy
        riches, the suppliant the dawning-place of Thy wisdom, the weak the
        source of Thy strength, the wretched the heaven of Thy bounty, the dumb
        the kingdom of Thy mention.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I testify, O my God, and my King, that Thou hast created me to remember
        Thee, to glorify Thee, and to aid Thy Cause. And yet, I have aided Thine
        enemies, who have broken Thy Covenant, who have cast away Thy Book,
        disbelieved in Thee, and repudiated Thy signs. Alas, alas, for my
        waywardness, and my shame, and my sinfulness, and my wrong-doing that
        have withheld me from the depths of the ocean of Thy unity and from
        fathoming the sea of Thy mercy. Wherefore, alas, alas! and again alas,
        alas! for my wretchedness and the grievousness of my transgressions!
        Thou didst call me into being, O my God, to exalt Thy Word, and to
        manifest Thy Cause. My heedlessness, however, hath deterred me and
        compassed me about, in such wise that I have arisen to blot out Thy
        signs, and to shed the blood of Thy loved ones, and of the
        dawning-places of Thy signs, and of the daysprings of Thy revelation,
        and of the repositories of Thy mysteries.
      </p>

      <p>
        “O Lord, my Lord! and again, O Lord, my Lord! and yet again, O Lord, my
        Lord! I bear witness that by reason of mine iniquity the fruits of the
        tree of Thy justice have fallen, and through the fire of my
        rebelliousness the hearts of such of Thy creatures as enjoy near access
        to Thee were consumed, and the souls of the sincere among Thy servants
        have melted. O wretched, wretched that I am! O the cruelties, the
        glaring cruelties, I inflicted! Woe is me, woe is me, for my remoteness
        from Thee, and for my waywardness, and mine ignorance, and my baseness,
        and my repudiation of Thee, and my protests against Thee! How many the
        days during which Thou didst bid Thy servants and Thy loved ones to
        protect me, whilst I commanded them to harm Thee and to harm them that
        Thou didst trust! And how numerous the nights during which Thou didst
        graciously remember me, and didst show me Thy path, whilst I turned away
        from Thee and from Thy signs! By Thy glory! O Thou Who art the Hope of
        such as have acknowledged Thy unity, and the Desire of the hearts of
        them that are rid of all attachment to any save Thee! I find no succorer
        except Thee, nor king, nor refuge, nor haven besides Thyself. Alas,
        alas! My turning away from Thee hath burnt up the veil of mine
        integrity, and my denial of Thee hath rent asunder the covering cast
        over mine honor. O would that I were beneath the depths of the earth, so
        that my evil deeds would remain unknown to Thy servants! Thou seest the
        sinner, O my Lord, who hath turned towards the dawning-place of Thy
        forgiveness and Thy bounty, and the mountain of iniquity that hath
        sought the heaven of Thy mercy and pardon. Alas, alas! My mighty sins
        have prevented me from approaching the court of Thy mercy, and my
        monstrous deeds have caused me to stray far from the sanctuary of Thy
        presence. Indeed, I am he that hath failed in duty towards Thee, and
        hath broken Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, and committed that which
        hath made the dwellers of the cities of Thy justice, and the
        dawning-places of Thy grace in Thy realms, to lament. I testify, O my
        God, that I have put away Thy commandments, and clung to the dictates of
        my passions, and have cast away the statutes of Thy Book, and seized the
        book of mine own desire. O misery, misery! As mine iniquities waxed
        greater and greater, Thy forbearance towards me augmented, and as the
        fire of my rebelliousness grew fiercer, the more did Thy forgiveness and
        Thy grace seek to smother up its flame. By the power of Thy might! O
        Thou Who art the desire of the world and the Best-Beloved of the
        nations! Thy long-suffering hath puffed me up, and Thy patience hath
        emboldened me. Thou beholdest, O my God, the tears that my shame hath
        caused to flow, and the sighs which my heedlessness hath led me to
        utter. I swear by the greatness of Thy majesty! I can find for myself no
        habitation save beneath the shadow of the court of Thy bounty, nor any
        refuge except under the canopy of Thy mercy. Thou seest me in the midst
        of a sea of despair and of hopelessness, after Thou didst cause me to
        hear Thy words “Despair not.” By Thy power! My sore injustice hath
        severed the cord of my hope, and my rebellion hath darkened my face
        before the throne of Thy justice. Thou beholdest, O my God, him who is
        as one dead fallen at the door of Thy favor, ashamed to seek from the
        hand of Thy loving-kindness the living waters of Thy pardon. Thou hast
        given me a tongue wherewith to remember and praise Thee, and yet it
        uttereth that which hath caused the souls of such of Thy chosen ones as
        are nigh unto Thee to melt, and the hearts of the sincere amongst the
        dwellers of the habitations of holiness to be consumed. Thou hast given
        me eyes to witness Thy signs, and to behold Thy verses, and to
        contemplate the revelations of Thine handiwork, but I have rejected Thy
        will, and have committed what hath caused the faithful among Thy
        creatures and the detached amidst Thy servants to groan. Thou hast given
        me ears that I may incline them unto Thy praise and Thy celebration, and
        unto that which Thou didst send down from the heaven of Thy bounty and
        the firmament of Thy
        <typo original="will">Will</typo>. And yet, alas, alas, I have forsaken
        Thy Cause, and have commanded Thy servants to blaspheme against Thy
        trusted ones and Thy loved ones, and have acted, before the throne of
        Thy justice, in such wise that those that have recognized Thy unity and
        are wholly devoted to Thee among the dwellers of Thy realm mourned with
        a sore lamentation. I know not, O my God, which among my evildoings to
        mention before the billowing ocean of Thy favor, nor which of my
        trespasses to declare when face to face with the splendors of the suns
        of Thy goodly gifts and bounties.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I beseech Thee, this very moment, by the mysteries of Thy Book, and by
        the things hid in Thy knowledge, and by the pearls that lie concealed
        within the shells of the ocean of Thy mercy, to reckon me among such as
        Thou didst mention in Thy Book and describe in Thy Tablets. Hast Thou
        decreed for me, O my God, any joy after this tribulation, or any relief
        to succeed this affliction, or any ease to follow this trouble? Alas,
        alas! Thou hast ordained that every pulpit be set apart for Thy mention,
        and for the glorification of Thy Word, and the revelation of Thy Cause,
        but I have ascended it to proclaim the violation of Thy Covenant, and
        have spoken unto Thy servants such words as have caused the dwellers of
        the Tabernacles of Thy majesty and the denizens of the Cities of Thy
        wisdom to lament. How often hast Thou sent down the food of Thine
        utterance out of the heaven of Thy bounty, and I denied it; and how
        numerous the occasions on which Thou hast summoned me to the soft
        flowing waters of Thy mercy, and I have chosen to turn away therefrom,
        by reason of my having followed my own wish and desire! By Thy glory! I
        know not for which sin to beg Thy forgiveness and implore Thy pardon,
        nor from which of mine iniquities to turn aside unto the Court of Thy
        bounteousness and the Sanctuary of Thy favor. Such are my sins and
        trespasses that no man can number them, nor pen describe them. I implore
        Thee, O Thou that turnest darkness into light, and revealest Thy
        mysteries on the Sinai of Thy Revelation, to aid me, at all times, to
        put my trust in Thee, and to commit mine affairs unto Thy care. Make me,
        then, O my God, content with that which the finger of Thy decree hath
        traced, and the pen of Thy ordinance hath written. Potent art Thou to do
        what pleaseth Thee, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all that are in
        heaven and on earth. No God is there but Thee, the All-knowing, the
        All-Wise.”
      </p>

      <p>
        O Shaykh! Know thou that neither the calumnies which men may utter, nor
        their denials, nor any cavils they may raise, can harm him that hath
        clung to the cord of the grace, and seized the hem of the mercy, of the
        Lord of creation. By God! He, the Glory of God (Bahá), hath spoken not
        from mere impulse. He that hath given Him a voice is He that hath given
        a voice unto all things, that they may praise and glorify Him. There is
        none other God but Him, the One, the Incomparable, the Lord of strength,
        the Unconditioned.
      </p>

      <p>
        They whose sight is keen, whose ears are retentive, whose hearts are
        enlightened, and whose breasts are dilated, recognize both truth and
        falsehood, and distinguish the one from the other. Recite thou this
        prayer that hath flowed from the tongue of this Wronged One, and ponder
        thereon with a heart rid of all attachment, and with ears that are pure
        and sanctified, be attentive to its meaning, that haply thou mayest
        inhale the breath of detachment and have pity upon thyself and upon
        others:
      </p>

      <p>
        “My God, the Object of my adoration, the Goal of my desire, the
        All-Bountiful, the Most Compassionate! All life is of Thee, and all
        power lieth within the grasp of Thine omnipotence. Whosoever Thou
        exaltest is raised above the angels, and attaineth the station: ‘Verily,
        We uplifted him to a place on high!’; and whosoever Thou dost abase is
        made lower than dust, nay, less than nothing. O Divine Providence!
        Though wicked, sinful, and intemperate, we still seek from Thee a ‘seat
        of truth,’ and long to behold the countenance of the Omnipotent King. It
        is Thine to command, and all sovereignty belongeth to Thee, and the
        realm of might boweth before Thy behest. Everything Thou doest is pure
        justice, nay, the very essence of grace. One gleam from the splendors of
        Thy Name, the All-Merciful, sufficeth to banish and blot out every trace
        of sinfulness from the world, and a single breath from the breezes of
        the Day of Thy Revelation is enough to adorn all mankind with a fresh
        attire. Vouchsafe Thy strength, O Almighty One, unto Thy weak creatures,
        and quicken them who are as dead, that haply they may find Thee, and may
        be led unto the ocean of Thy guidance, and may remain steadfast in Thy
        Cause. Should the fragrance of Thy praise be shed abroad by any of the
        divers tongues of the world, out of the East or out of the West, it
        would, verily, be prized and greatly cherished. If such tongues,
        however, be deprived of that fragrance, they assuredly would be unworthy
        of any mention, in word or yet in thought. We beg of Thee, O Providence,
        to show Thy way unto all men, and to guide them aright. Thou art,
        verily, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the All-Knowing, the
        All-Seeing.”
      </p>

      <p>
        We beseech God to aid thee to be just and fair-minded, and to acquaint
        thee with the things that were hidden from the eyes of men. He, in
        truth, is the Mighty, the Unconstrained. We ask thee to reflect upon
        that which hath been revealed, and to be fair and just in thy speech,
        that perchance the splendors of the daystar of truthfulness and
        sincerity may shine forth, and may deliver thee from the darkness of
        ignorance, and illumine the world with the light of knowledge. This
        Wronged One hath frequented no school, neither hath He attended the
        controversies of the learned. By My life! Not of Mine own volition have
        I revealed Myself, but God, of His own choosing, hath manifested Me. In
        the Tablet, addressed to His Majesty the Sháh—may God, blessed and
        glorified be He, assist him—these words have streamed from the tongue of
        this Wronged One:
      </p>

      <p>
        “O King! I was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo, the
        breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me the
        knowledge of all that hath been. This thing is not from Me, but from One
        Who is Almighty and All-Knowing. And He bade Me lift up My voice between
        earth and heaven, and for this there befell Me what hath caused the
        tears of every man of understanding to flow. The learning current
        amongst men I studied not; their schools I entered not. Ask of the city
        wherein I dwelt, that thou mayest be well assured that I am not of them
        who speak falsely. This is but a leaf which the winds of the will of thy
        Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised, have stirred. Can it be still when
        the tempestuous winds are blowing? Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of all
        Names and Attributes! They move it as they list. The evanescent is as
        nothing before Him Who is the Ever-Abiding. His all-compelling summons
        hath reached Me, and caused Me to speak His praise amidst all people. I
        was indeed as one dead when His behest was uttered. The hand of the will
        of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Merciful, transformed Me.”
